# Fixing Supabase Connection Issues in Production

This guide provides steps to fix the issue where users can't see data from Supabase after logging in when deployed on Vercel.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Environment Variables**: Vercel environment variables not being properly injected into the client-side code
2. **Service Worker Issues**: Service worker caching Supabase API requests causing stale data
3. **Error Handling**: Inadequate error handling for connection issues

## Files Modified

We've made the following changes to fix these issues:

1. **src/lib/supabase.ts**
   - Added fallback values for Supabase URL and Anon Key
   - Improved error handling and debugging
   - Added production-specific error logging

2. **public/service-worker.js**
   - Modified fetch handler to skip caching Supabase API requests
   - Fixed issue with Response body cloning
   - Improved error handling for API requests

3. **public/supabase-fallback.js** (new file)
   - Added fallback script to ensure Supabase environment variables are always available

4. **public/vercel.env.js** (new file)
   - Added script to ensure Vercel environment variables are properly set

5. **src/utils/pwa.ts**
   - Simplified service worker registration and management
   - Added better health checks and recovery mechanisms

6. **index.html**
   - Added the fallback scripts before the main application script

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Set Environment Variables in Vercel**

   Make sure the following environment variables are set in your Vercel project:

   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://hsmuxnsfzkffzmhbmtts.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImhzbXV4bnNmemtmZnptaGJtdHRzIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYVQiOjE3NDg3MDE0ODMsImV4cCI6MjA2NDI3NzQ4M30.0y17sSd6pDwJzj4VXqJiclAQeI3V_dtFihbtF-jlcTI
   ```

2. **Deploy the Changes**

   Push the changes to your repository and trigger a new Vercel deployment.

3. **Verify the Fix**

   After deployment, test the application by:
   - Logging in with valid credentials
   - Verifying that data is loaded from Supabase
   - Checking the browser console for any errors

4. **Clear Service Worker Cache (If Needed)**

   If users still experience issues, they may need to clear their browser cache:
   
   ```javascript
   // Run this in the browser console
   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
     navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function(registrations) {
       for(let registration of registrations) {
         registration.unregister();
       }
     });
   }
   caches.keys().then(function(names) {
     for (let name of names) caches.delete(name);
   });
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify that the environment variables are correctly set in Vercel
3. Try incognito/private browsing mode to rule out cache issues
4. Check if the Supabase project is online and accessible

## Future Improvements

1. Implement more robust error handling for database connection issues
2. Add better offline support with local data caching
3. Improve service worker update mechanism
4. Add health checks for Supabase connection status
